An old project of mine. The goal was just to test out writing
a short game that was all in a single file, and to do it as fast
as possible.

The game is basically to avoid getting hit by projectiles while trying to get to the other side of the level. Everything is randomly generated.

Made in C++, using SFML's system, window, and graphics modules.
